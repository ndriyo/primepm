## Product Context

### Why This Project Exists
Organizations often lack a structured, consistent mechanism for selecting which projects to fund or pursue. Many rely on spreadsheets, manual scoring, or politics-driven decisions. Our SaaS PMIS ensures **transparency** and **strategic alignment** by providing a centralized system to **define** criteria, **rate** projects, and **simulate** portfolios under different constraints.

### Problems It Solves

1. **Subjective Project Selection**  
   - Establishes standardized criteria (e.g., ROI, strategic alignment, risk, urgency) to minimize bias.

2. **Scattered Data & Manual Tools**  
   - Consolidates key project info and scoring in one platform, eliminating conflicting spreadsheets.

3. **Poor Visibility for Decision-Makers**  
   - Offers real-time dashboards, scoring breakdowns, and scenario simulations to guide resource allocation.

### How It Should Work (User Experience)

1. **Define Criteria & Weights**  
   - PMO sets up or updates the evaluation criteria each year or before major submission cycles.

2. **Project Proposals & Self-Assessment**  
   - Project Managers propose new projects, providing basic info and self-scoring. The system automatically applies the latest criteria.

3. **Committee Scoring**  
   - Committee members, after reviewing each project’s details, add their own scores. The system calculates aggregate scores.

4. **Portfolio Simulation**  
   - Management runs “what-if” analyses by toggling constraints—budget, resources, mandatory projects—and sees which set of projects yields the highest total value.

5. **Final Selection & Reporting**  
   - Once management finalizes decisions, the platform locks that cycle’s portfolio and generates comprehensive reports.

### User Experience Goals

- **Seamless Onboarding**: Quick sign-up via email, Google, or Microsoft. Organization administrators can invite team members easily.  
- **Intuitive Dashboards**: Real-time, visual scoring distributions and portfolio suggestions.  
- **Action-Oriented Views**: Each user type sees only relevant tasks (PMs see project submission pages, Committee sees scoring pages, etc.).  
- **Smooth Collaboration**: Committee members and management can see up-to-date scores, leaving comments or feedback if desired.

### Expanded User Flows

- **PMO Flow**:  
  1. Create/edit criteria → 2. Publish for the current cycle → 3. Monitor project submissions and timelines → 4. Review final committee scores.

- **Project Manager Flow**:  
  1. Login → 2. Submit new project or edit existing → 3. Provide self-assessment → 4. View final scoring results and portfolio decisions.

- **Committee Flow**:  
  1. Login → 2. Access assigned projects → 3. Enter scores with justifications → 4. Submit final scoring → 5. Review aggregated outcomes.

- **Management Flow**:  
  1. Configure constraints → 2. Run portfolio simulations → 3. Select recommended set → 4. Adjust manually → 5. Approve final portfolio → 6. Export and communicate results.
