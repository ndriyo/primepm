# Project Progress Tracker

## What Works
- Fixed department data display in ProjectsTable:
  - Department names now correctly show in the projects table
  - Implemented efficient department lookup in the API
  - Added proper TypeScript support for the new data structure

- Excel import feature:
  - Download Excel template with dynamic criteria structure
  - Upload and validation of Excel files with project data
  - Comprehensive validation for project fields and criteria scores
  - Role-based validation (PM can only import for their department)
  - Support for both new projects and updates to existing projects
  - Import interface with progress indicators and detailed validation results
  - Single-page workflow with modular component architecture
- Enhanced project search and filtering system:
  - Advanced filtering by multiple criteria (department, budget range, resources, dates, status, tags)
  - Improved search functionality across name, description, and tags fields
  - Combobox implementation for department and status filters with multiple selection
  - Budget and resource filters with thousand separator formatting
  - Pagination with page numbers for easier navigation through large result sets
  - URL parameter synchronization for shareable search results
  - Server-side filtering with optimized API endpoints
- Improved navigation flow between project views:
  - Cancel button on project details page for quick return to search
  - Edit button navigation with proper state preservation
  - Consistent button placement across project views
  - Visual clarity with appropriate icons for actions
- React Context providers with optimized rendering:
  - Fixed infinite update loop bugs in ProjectContext and CriteriaContext
  - Enhanced state updates with deep comparison to prevent unnecessary renders
  - Improved weight settings initialization to avoid "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
  - Implemented proper dependency management in useEffect hooks
- Basic application structure and routing
- Dashboard UI with placeholder components:
  - Metrics summary cards
  - Status distribution chart
  - Risk quadrant visualization
  - Top projects listing
- Project data model with sample projects
- Project selection table view
- Navigation between main application sections
- Responsive layout with improved UX:
  - Collapsible sidebar with toggle functionality
  - Proper content resizing when sidebar is collapsed
  - Persistent sidebar state across page navigation
  - Mobile-friendly navigation with fixed header
  - CSS Grid and Flexbox layout for better space utilization
- Loading experience with skeleton placeholders:
  - Skeleton components for cards, tables, text, and charts
  - Pulse animation effect for visual feedback
  - Component-specific skeleton placeholders matching actual content structure
  - Loading wrappers for easy integration with React Query
- Criteria management interface with versioning:
  - Create, edit, and delete criteria versions
  - Set active version for project scoring
  - Add, edit, and delete criteria with detailed properties
  - Define scale and rubric for each criterion
- AHP wizard for criteria weighting:
  - Pairwise comparisons between criteria
  - Automatic weight calculation based on AHP algorithm
  - Progress tracking and navigation
- Custom UI components:
  - Confirmation dialogs with improved UX
  - Warning notifications for incomplete weights
- Project entry and self-assessment:
  - Multi-step form with progress tracking
  - Basic information entry (name, description, department, budget, duration, resources, tags) with proper formatting
  - Self-assessment using card-based option selection with descriptions for each score
  - Project review and submission workflow with formatted values
  - Cancel button for easy navigation back to project list
- Project information display:
  - Clean presentation of project details
  - Resources display with thousand separator formatting
  - Criteria analysis with visual indicators
- Deployment configuration:
  - Netlify deployment setup with netlify.toml
  - Next.js build output configuration
- Database schema and persistence layer:
  - Prisma ORM schema defined for all entities
  - SQL migration scripts for database setup with PostgreSQL
  - Repository pattern implementation for data access
  - Audit logging for all CRUD operations
  - Entity relationships and type definitions
  - Multi-tenant data isolation with RLS
  - Role-based access control
- Frontend connected to database repositories:
  - API routes for entities (projects, criteria, versions)
  - React Query hooks for data fetching and caching
  - Adapter pattern to convert between repository and UI models
  - Loading and error states in components
  - Type-safe API calls with proper error handling
- Mock authentication system for development:
  - AuthContext provider with sample users and organizations
  - Automatic auth header injection for API requests
  - Developer UI for switching between users and organizations
  - Integration with database RLS for proper data isolation
  - Repository-level RLS support via Prisma client extensions
- TypeScript compliance throughout the application:
  - Proper handling of nullable fields in repository interfaces
  - Consistent type casting patterns for database results
  - Correctly typed transaction handlers with appropriate return values
  - Fixed Prisma client extension parameter typing in $allOperations
  - Suspense boundaries for components using useSearchParams()

## In Progress
- Full authentication system implementation with NextAuth
- Committee review interface

## Next Steps
- User role management UI
- Multi-tenant UI customization
- Portfolio simulation based on constraints
- Data export functionality

## Known Issues
- Mock authentication is for development only - needs real implementation
- Project selection algorithm not fully implemented
- Form data is not persisted if user navigates away
- Criteria weights need to be recalculated when criteria are added or removed
